# MultilayerdPerceptron
Implementation of MLP in python

### - Module Main:
The test module. In this module the mlp train trought the data set and print errors on training set and validation set.

### - Module Functions:
Module where the active functions (with relative derivation) and distribution functions are stored. 
In particular, for the active functions, there are: Relu, Sigmoid, Lazy_Relu

### - Module MultilayerPerceptron:
Class that define a Neural Network(NN) - MLP with the initialization of all weights, bais and backpropagation algorithm.
